## About

> I am currently a student in the third year of the engineering cycle in computer science and networks option MIAGE at the Moroccan School of Engineering Sciences Casablanca.
I am curious, motivated with a clear vision regarding my professional career and able to easily integrate a team as well as work with agile approach methods. I have a great willingness to learn and discover new technologies in this sense too.
I am open to any proposal that could deepen my knowledge and skills, and enrich my training, as well as allow me to discover the field of work, and adopt the standards and best practices of the IT field in a professional environment.
